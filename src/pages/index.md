          “BotXO enables you to start using chatbots to solve specific tasks
          already today. As BotXO integrates with 3rd party services, the
          platform can scale with your needs and matureness as a company.  BotXO
          connects business services such as E-commerce, Customer Support, CRM,
          Social Media and as a result erases the internal and external
          boundaries between systems and replaces it with one coherent
          user-friendly interface.
